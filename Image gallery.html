        More than a site, this is a tech demo. It's designed with the purpose of
        pushing my programming skill to the limit, by making an image gallery
        using html, css and java together, using technology I don't know too
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buttons, outside of their functionality, have an animation. They
        aren't actually buttons, but inputs with an image src. Below them are
        hidden images of pressed buttons. When clicked, the input is hidden and
        the image is shown. There is a 200ms delay, after which the input is
        displayed with block and the image is hidden once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The big image the gallery is displaying is identified by its id, with a
        specific naming convention - A 0 and the order of the image. The first
        image is called 00, the second is called 01, and so on. Each time the
        "buttons" are pressed, the variable x is changed, and a for loop is
        started. Variable s is created, starting from 0 and ending at 7. If the
        current x matches s, the image is displayed with block. If it isn't,
        it's hidden. The appropriate image id is identified with another
        variable called ss, which is defined as 0+s, following the naming
        convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may ask why ss is a thing, when I could simply name the images by
        their order. However, when the image displayed is switched, I also have
        to insure the miniature display below is lit correctly - The currently
        displayed image has to have an orange border, to single it out. It's
        those images that have their id match their order. So, in the for loop,
        their id is also grabbed based on s, and their class is changed to
        gridLit, turning their border orange.

        The purpose of the miniature display below is so that you can quickly
        change to the image you like without having to spam the buttons. This
        was slightly more complicated, since it required me to grab the id of
        the clicked image. However, once the id is there, the correct image is
        switched with very the same type of loop as the big image one. Only
        difference is the lack of x.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, that doesn't mean x plays no role. If x isn't changed, the next
        time the buttons are used wouldn't continute from the right slot. It
        wouldn't be in cronological order anymore. Therefore, x is changed to
        the id of the clicked image.
      </p>

        These are the basics of my site. It may be small and pretty pointless,
        but I'm proud of this achievement! It works, and unlike many things, it
        is complete. Hopefully, maybe you can pick up a trick or two from it!

        Apoligies to all mobile users lol, this is designed for a pc, and since
        it's just a tech demo I can't be bothered to make it look pretty. Just
        enjoy the buttons!
